<p align="center">An HTTP transport layer built on Gland's event-driven architecture ‚Äì fully pluggable, protocol-agnostic, and minimal.</p>

## Description

> What if HTTP was just another event?

**@glandjs/http** is the official HTTP adapter for the Gland architecture. It implements an extensible and modular layer that transforms incoming HTTP requests into Gland-compatible events and routes them to the appropriate channel for processing.

Unlike traditional HTTP routers, this package does not define ‚Äúcontrollers‚Äù or ‚Äúroutes‚Äù in a conventional sense. Instead, it seamlessly integrates with the Gland event system, allowing you to treat HTTP interactions just like any other message within the system.

## Features

- üö¶ Lightweight HTTP server (Express, Fastify support planned)
- üîå Pluggable HTTP broker with full channel support
- üì¶ Built-in request lifecycle hooks
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully integrated with Gland DI container and event broker
- üõ°Ô∏è Supports middleware-style interceptors via event channels
- üåê Easily extendable to support REST APIs, RPC over HTTP, etc.

## Philosophy

HTTP is just a transport layer.

`@glandjs/http` treats HTTP not as a monolithic interface but as a message-based protocol. Instead of focusing on REST conventions, it listens to HTTP events, converts them to internal messages, and passes them through the same event-driven lifecycle used throughout Gland.

By abstracting away the server and routing logic, we allow developers to focus on core application behavior and reuse the same channel logic across different protocols (WebSocket, RPC, etc.).
